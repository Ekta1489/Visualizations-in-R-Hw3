# Question 1

\#\#Loading the instacart dataset. Counting the number of aisles using
the count function. The total number of isles are given by
aisle\_order\_count. Finding out which aisles are the most items ordered
from.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
insta_aisles = instacart %>% 
  count(aisle, name = "aisle_order_count") %>% #counting the number of aisles 
  arrange(desc(aisle_order_count)) #arranging the aisle_order_count by descending

# The maximum number of orders are placed from the fresh vegetables and fresh fruits aisle. 
```

\#Making a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered by using the
filter function to limit this to aisles with more than 10000 items.
aisle name is shown on y axis so that it is more legible.

``` r
insta_aisles %>% 
  filter(aisle_order_count > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle_order_count, y = aisle)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw3_Ec3342_files/figure-gfm/ggplot-1.png)<!-- --> \#Creating a
table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking
ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”.Including the number of times each item is ordered.

``` r
instacart_new = instacart %>% 
  select(aisle_id, aisle, product_name) %>% #selected the variables aisle_id, aisle, product_name
  filter(
    aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  #Filtered to include the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”
  count(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  top_n(3) 
```

    ## Selecting by n

\#Creating a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
formating this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
icecream_apples = instacart %>% 
  filter(
    product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  select(
    order_dow, order_hour_of_day, product_name) %>%
  arrange(
    desc(order_dow)) %>% 
  group_by(
    order_dow) %>% 
  summarise(
    average_order_hour_of_day = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  mutate(
    order_dow = recode(
      order_dow, `1` = 'Mon', `2` = 'Tues', `3` = 'Wed', `4` = 'Thur', `5` = 'Fri', `6` = 'Sat', `0` = 'Sun')) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, values_from = average_order_hour_of_day)
kable(icecream_apples)
```

|  Sun |      Mon |     Tues |      Wed |     Thur |      Fri |   Sat |

| 13.6 | 12.17391 | 12.83824 | 14.68519 | 13.17308 | 12.64286 | 13.25 |

    (9784), Organic Raspberries (5546), Organic Blueberries (4966)

# Question 2

\#\#Loading the BRFSS data and cleaning the data. Formatted the data to
use appropriate variable names. Filtered the topic to “Overall Health”,
included only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”, Organize responses
as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010") 
health = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% #formatted the data to use appropriate variable names
  filter(
    topic == "Overall Health"
    ) %>% #focused on the “Overall Health” topic
  filter(
    response %in% c("Excellent","Very good","Good","Fair","Poor")
    ) %>% #included only responses from “Excellent”to “Poor”
  mutate(
    response = as.factor(response),
    response = fct_relevel(
      response, "Poor","Fair","Good","Very good","Excellent")
    ) %>% #organized responses as factors. 
  arrange(response) 
```

\#\#In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What
about in 2010?

``` r
states_02 = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>%  
  janitor::clean_names() %>% #formatted the data to use appropriate variable names
  select(
    locationabbr, locationdesc, year
    ) %>% 
  filter(
    year == "2002"
    ) %>% #filtered to include only the year 2002
  group_by(
    locationabbr
    ) %>% 
  summarise(
    n_location = n_distinct(locationdesc) 
    ) %>%
  filter(n_location >= 7)

states_10 = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>%  
  janitor::clean_names() %>% #formatted the data to use appropriate variable names
  select(
    locationabbr, locationdesc, year) %>% 
  filter(
    year == "2010" #filtered to include only the year 2010
    ) %>%
  group_by(
    locationabbr
    ) %>% 
  summarise(
    n_location = n_distinct(locationdesc)
    ) %>%
  filter(n_location >= 7)
```

  - In 2002, the states observed at 7 or more locations are : CT, FL,
    MA, NC, NJ, PA
  - In 2010, the states observed at 7 or more locations are : CA, CO,
    FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA

\#Constructed a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
across locations within a state.

``` r
excellent = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(
    year, locationabbr, response, data_value
    ) %>% 
  filter(
    response == "Excellent"
    ) %>%
 group_by(
   year, locationabbr
   ) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_val = mean(data_value)
    )
```

\#Making a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a
state (that is, make a plot showing a line for each state across
years

``` r
ggplot(excellent, aes(x = year, y = mean_val, color = factor(locationabbr))) +   geom_line() +   theme_bw()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values (geom_path).

![](p8105_hw3_Ec3342_files/figure-gfm/spaghetti%20plot-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
plot = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(
    year %in% c("2006","2010")
  ) %>%
  select(
    year, locationabbr, response, data_value, locationdesc
    ) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair","Poor")
  ) %>%
  filter(locationabbr == "NY") %>%
  group_by(year, locationdesc, locationabbr) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value, fill = locationdesc)) +
  geom_bar(start = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  facet_grid(year ~.) +
  labs(x = "Response", y = "Data Value", title = "Distribution of responses among locations in NY")
```

# Question 3

\#Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
(e.g. what variables exist, how many observations,
etc).

``` r
accel_data = read_csv(file = "./data/accel_data.csv") %>% #reading the csv file
janitor::clean_names() %>% #cleaning variable names 
mutate(
  wkday_wkend = factor((day %in% c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday')),levels = c(FALSE, TRUE), labels = c('Weekend', 'Weekday')) #Added a weekday vs weekend variable called wkday_wkend
) %>%
select(week, day_id, day, wkday_wkend, everything()) #selected the variables so that the table is more readable
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

\#Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to create a total
activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals.
Are any trends apparent?

``` r
accel_data %>%
mutate(
  total_act = rowSums(select(.,activity_1:activity_1440)) #created a total_act variable that aggregates across minutes
  ) %>%
  select(week, day_id, day, wkday_wkend, total_act) %>%
  kable()
