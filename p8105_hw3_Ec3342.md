# Question 1

\#\#Loading the instacart dataset. Counting the number of aisles using
the count function. The total number of isles are given by
aisle\_order\_count. Finding out which aisles are the most items ordered
from.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
insta_aisles = instacart %>% 
  count(aisle, name = "aisle_order_count") %>% 
  arrange(desc(aisle_order_count))
```

\#Making a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered by using the
filter function to limit this to aisles with more than 10000 items.
aisle name is shown on y axis so that it is more legible.

``` r
insta_aisles %>% 
  filter(aisle_order_count > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle_order_count, y = aisle)) + geom_point()
```
